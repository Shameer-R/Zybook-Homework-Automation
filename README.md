# zyBooks Homework Automation

This a Python 3 script that automates zyBooks participation activites. This currently applies to zyBooks': Short answer questions, Multiple Choice Questions, and Slides Presentations. I don't have plans to maintain this script but I will accept any helpful pull requests.

# Requirements

1) The Firefox web browser which can be installed from [Mozilla's Official Website](https://pages.github.com/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
2) Python 3 which can be installed from [Python's Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# Installation

1) Download ```main.py``` to the directory of your choice.
2) Install the necessary packages by running ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` from the installation directory

# Usage

When you run the script, you'll be prompted for:
1) Your email
2) Your password
3) The course you want to automate
4) The specific homework assignment you want to complete

The script will then run through all the participation activities in the assignemnt of your choosing.


Sometimes the script will throw out an error or give off faulty prompts, just rerun the script to fix the problem.
